        "extraDetails": "An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses sound waves to create a picture also known as a sonogram of organs, tissues, and other structures inside the body. Unlike x-rays, ultrasounds don’t use any radiation. An ultrasound can also show parts of the body in motion, such as a heart beating or blood flowing through blood vessels,        There are two main categories of ultrasounds: pregnancy ultrasound and diagnostic ultrasound.        1. Pregnancy ultrasound is used to look at an unborn baby. The test can provide information about a baby’s growth, development, and overall health.        2. Diagnostic ultrasound is used to view and provide information about other internal parts of the body. These include the heart, blood vessels, liver, bladder, kidneys, and female reproductive organs.          Other names: sonogram, ultrasonography, pregnancy sonography, fetal ultrasound, obstetric ultrasound, diagnostic medical sonography, diagnostic medical ultrasound"

This allows blood to flow more freely and supply the heart muscle with enough oxygen. Usually, it is combined with the insertion of a Stent which is a small stainless steel mesh tube which keeps the artery open and prevents re-narrowing from occurring."

Real-time ECG waveform freezing and review to assist with diagnosis        ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY:        Echocardiography is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working.              EXERCISE TOLERANCE TEST:        An exercise tolerance test ETT - also known as an exercise electrocardiogram ECG - can help to assess the severity of coronary heart disease. In this condition there is narrowing of the blood vessels supplying the heart.        ABPM:        Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ABPM is a non-invasive method of obtaining blood pressure readings over a 24-hour period, whilst the patient is in their own environment, representing a true reflection of their blood pressure.         HOLTER:        A Holter monitor is a battery-operated portable device that measures and records patien’s heart’s activity ECG continuously for 24 to 48 hours or longer depending on the type of monitoring used. The device is the size of a small camera. It has wires with silver dollar-sized electrodes that attach to patient’s skin."
